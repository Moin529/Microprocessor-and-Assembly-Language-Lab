1. Write a function countFrequency that takes an array of integers and returns a new array of pairs, where each pair contains a unique number and its frequency.
Input: The first line contains an integer n — the size of the array. The second line contains n integers representing the elements of the array.
Output: pairs of numbers, where each pair consists of a unique number followed by its frequency. The pairs must be printed in ascending order of the unique numbers—one pair per line.

2. Write a function rotateArray that rotates an array to the right by k positions. For example, rotating [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] by 2 positions results in [4, 5, 1, 2, 3].
Input: The first line contains two integers n and k — the size of the array and the number of positions to rotate. The second line contains n integers representing the elements of the array.
Output: Print the array after it has been rotated to the right by k positions—one item per line.

3. Write a program that takes an array of integers and a threshold value. Create a function averageAboveThreshold that returns the average of all elements greater than the threshold. If no such element exists, return 0.
Example:
Input: arr = [4, 9, 2, 10, 7], threshold = 5  
Output: 8.67
Input
The first line contains two integers n and threshold — the size of the array and the threshold value.
The second line contains n integers representing the elements of the array.

Output
Print the average of all elements greater than the threshold, rounded to two decimal places.
If no elements exceed the threshold, print 0.
